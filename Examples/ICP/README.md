# ICP (Iterative closest point) - Python Example 

All this examples based on niosus's Github Repo 

> Github Link : [`niosus/notebooks`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/niosus/notebooks/blob/master/icp.ipynb)

## Folder Structure

```
├── icp_basic.ipynb
├── icp.ipynb
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

### It contains two Jupyter notebooks

1. `icp.ipynb` : Full version of ICP notebook forked from [`niosus/notebooks`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/niosus/notebooks/blob/master/icp.ipynb)
2. `icp_basic.ipynb` : Simple Version of `icp.ipynb`, only contains linear ICP and Few plots

If it's your first time with ICP, I recommend to start from `icp_basic.ipynb`

# How to use

1. Prepare python virtual environment

We recommend to use `Anaconda`, since we tested all those things on that. You can create your environments only for this example like this.


* Anaconda Setup
  
```bash
$ conda activate <your-conda-env>
$ cd Examples/ICP
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Lastly, Open notebooks with your prefered platform `VScode` / `Jupyter Notebook` / `Jupyter Lab` ...
> Notebooks already contains kindful explanations, so just follow the instruction. Cheer up!!
